Hey, I'm Will Chandler.

A sixth-generation Texan, I've lived in Mexico, Scotland, and Spain. I'm currently based in Austin, with dreams of the Pacific Northwest.

For many years, I went down a liberal arts and social sciences path. I studied Spanish and earned a Masters in international relations. I supervised complex international academic programs, and managed an interdisciplinary human rights center. 

But throughout this journey, I knew that my true calling lay elsewhere. Programming had always intrigued me, and when I finally took the plunge into web development, it was clear that I had found my lifelong career.

I completed a full stack web development bootcamp through UT Austin, and now I'm a UI developer.
