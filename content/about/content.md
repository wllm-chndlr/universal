Hey, I'm Will.

A sixth-generation Texan, I've lived in Mexico, Scotland, and Spain. My family (partner: Jacqueline, son: Lochlan, daughter: Aila, dogs: Maggie + Griffin) and I are currently based in Austin, with dreams of the Pacific Northwest.

For many years, I went down a liberal arts and social sciences path. I studied Spanish and earned a Masters in international relations. I supervised complex international academic programs, and managed an interdisciplinary human rights center. I worked on teams with people from multiple continents, and learned new ways of engaging with the world.

But throughout this journey, I knew that my true calling lay elsewhere. Programming had always intrigued me, and when I finally took the plunge into web development, it was clear that I had found my lifelong career.

I recently completed a full stack web development bootcamp through UT Austin, and learned more than I ever could have imagined. I am now a passionate full stack Javascript developer. For me, coding is exciting and invigorating. There are always new challenges and new learning opportunities.
